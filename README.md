# ArtHouse Landing Website

This repository contains the **ArtHouse Landing Website** â€” the marketing and onboarding hub for the ArtHouse creative networking platform.

The website's purpose is to:
- Present the **ArtHouse brand** in a premium, minimal, tech-forward aesthetic.
- Collect **email signups** via Beehiiv.
- Allow creatives to **apply** for platform access via a Firebase-connected artist form.
- Serve as a secure, reliable entry point without breaking mobile app backend integrations.

  - Do NOT change rules, indexes, or sensitive settings without approval.
  - Store application data in a clearly defined collection (e.g., `/applications`).
  - Confirm admin visibility in Firebase Console.

## 5. Development Workflow

1. Create a **feature branch** from `dev`.
2. Implement and test changes locally.
3. Commit and push to **`dev` branch**.
4. Use **Vercel Preview Deployment** to verify functionality & styling.
5. Once approved, merge `dev` â†’ `main`.

## 6. Deployment Rules

- **SSL:** All pages must be HTTPS-secured.
- If domain routing involves Squarespace, coordinate DNS changes to avoid downtime.
- Check SSL status post-deployment.

---

## 7. Security & Data Protection

- No user data may be deleted, overwritten, or exposed.
- Form submissions must validate input before writing to Firebase.
- Protect API keys via `.env` variables (never commit secrets to Git).
